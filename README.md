## 📘 School Management System

# 📌 Project Overview

The School Management System is a console-based Java application developed to manage school-related data such as students, staff and subjects. The project demonstrates the use of Java OOP concepts, JDBC connectivity and SQL database operations for structured data management.
This project was developed as an Individual Project during Semester 2 as part of academic learning.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- SQL Database
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures (Basic usage)

# ✨ Features

- Manage Student details
- Manage Staff details
- Manage Subject details
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Menu-driven console interface using switch-case
- Database integration using JDBC

# 🧩 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following classes:

- SchoolManagementSystem Class
  - Contains the main() method
  - Establishes JDBC database connection
  - Controls application flow using switch-case
  - Calls operation methods for Student, Staff, and Subject

- Student Class
  - Handles CRUD operations related to student data

- Staff Class
  - Handles CRUD operations related to staff data

- Subject Class
  - Handles CRUD operations related to subject data

🔹 A basic implementation attempt of HashMap was included to demonstrate Data Structure usage.

# 🗄️ Database Functionality

Uses SQL database for persistent data storage
JDBC is used to:
 - Insert records
 - Fetch records
 - Update records
 - Delete records

# ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-link>

2. Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code).
3. Configure your SQL database and update JDBC connection details.
4. Run the Main class.
5. Use the console menu to perform operations.
